name=search_term_string","Organization","https://genplusmedia.online/uploads/20230816-163004.jpeg","Anthony Gordon gave the hosts the lead in a chaotic first half, seeing Trent Alexander-Arnold fortunately escape a red card early in the game, while Virgil van Dijk was sent off early.","Things were still not very bright for Jurgen Klopp's men until Darwin Nunez came on as a substitute, quickly scored and not only was satisfied with 1 point, he continued to score in injury time to impress determined&nbsp;a dramatic 2-1 victory&nbsp;for the visitors.&nbsp;Here are the highlights of the match.","Day of Mistakes","As has become the norm for Newcastle under Eddie Howe, their games at St James' Park often start at breakneck speed.&nbsp;Although they did not have an early goal against Liverpool, their approach to the game could have sent an opposing player off the field.&nbsp;Trent Alexander-Arnold was unlucky to receive an early ticket for buying time.&nbsp;However, he was lucky to escape a yellow card when he fouled Gordon.","Not long after that, the full-back became a criminal when he lost the ball at his feet, allowing the former Everton star to freely steal the ball and ice towards the goal, scoring the opener.","But the home team also hates the defense, which is their pride.&nbsp;Sven Botman played well most of the game, making a mistake in possession, creating a chance for Nunez to score a late equalizer.","Van Dijk's Madness",'<img src="https://media.bongda.com.vn/files/thu.phan/2023/08/28/c0125d17ba69d2b8b9147193d9f0cf45-0123.jpg" alt="5 highlights - Football" width="640" height="401" align="center" style="max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;">',"Things got worse for&nbsp;Liverpool&nbsp;after the goal.&nbsp;The host's delicate play helped Alexander Isak break through the Red Brigade defense unimpeded.&nbsp;In an attempt to stop the player, Van Dijk cut him down in front of the box.&nbsp;The red card is immediately drawn.&nbsp;Claiming that he touched the ball first, the Dutch midfielder expressed his anger at the referee, refused to leave the field and then shouted at the fourth referee as he entered the tunnel.&nbsp;The slow motion image shows that the referee team was right.&nbsp;Van Dijk touched Isak's right foot before touching the ball.","Jota doesn't lie","After the Bournemouth game with Allister being sent off, Jota said in an interview:&nbsp;\"We joked on the bench that we're almost as good as 10 instead of 11. I think people really do. I felt it was a time to be able to help each other, to be closer. And I think that's what we did. We took the three points and I think it was well deserved.\"","He himself proved this statement.&nbsp;When he lost people early, Klopp tried to make many changes depending on the stage of the game.&nbsp;In the 58th minute, Jota replaced Cody Gakpo and created a more positive signal.&nbsp;It was he who moved to find space and then hit the pass that led to Botman's mistake to help Nunez score the equalizer.","The Uruguayan was substituted in the second half as Klopp tried to save a point.&nbsp;That decision of the German strategist turned out to be a game changer.&nbsp;When playing wide to the right, Nunez proved to be more effective than when playing in other positions.&nbsp;","He is often seen as a plug-in and left-winger (in the Benfica era).&nbsp;When coming to Liverpool, Nunez often swapped positions with Mane (former) or Luis Diaz (current), but his form fluctuated.&nbsp;When he plays on the right, he will need a partner who is good and often prunes the ball, as evidenced by the important passes of Jota and Salah that helped Nunez score a brace against Newcastle.",'<img src="https://media.bongda.com.vn/files/thu.phan/2023/08/28/f4jjolvbmaabeem-0124.jpg" alt="5 highlights - Football" width="630" height="378" align="center" style="max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;">',"Newcastle died from pressing","Newcastle have emerged with a strong defensive ability in recent times, but when playing at home in a dominant position and leading for a long time, they have played with excitement against a great opponent, betraying their style has made them Embrace hate.&nbsp;At the first goal, they pushed the team up and pressed to reveal space for Jota.&nbsp;The second goal conceded,&nbsp;Newcastle&nbsp;let Harvey Elliott press to win the ball in the middle of the field, Salah was in a position similar to Jota, helping Nunez to set the score.",'\x3c!-- Composite Start --\x3e\r\n<div id="M878891ScriptRootC1448107"></div>\r\n<script src="https://jsc.adskeeper.com/b/a/baly.online.1448107.js" async><\/script>\r\n\x3c!-- Composite End --\x3e',"Mặc định","Post detail","Adskeeper","Entertainment","/category/entertainment/","/category/football/","/category/tattoo/","Lifestyle","/category/lifestyle/","/category/zaly-online-tattoo/","About Us","/about-us/","Contact","/contact/","Privacy Policy","/privacy-policy/","https://zaly.online/@breadcrumb")</script><script src="/_nuxt/b93c864.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/40d6947.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/5a91ee8.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/174125f.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/7b04f1b.js" defer></script>
